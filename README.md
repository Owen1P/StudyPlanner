Thankyou for viewing my project!

To use/run this project open a terminal on your computer and use git clone https://github.com/Owen1P/StudyPlanner.git.

Make sure that you have a fully realeased and integrated version of .NET (version 4-7) as of December 2024 s WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) the UI I used does not work well with .NET 8 or .NET 9

Once you have the project open before running it make sure you:

1. cd StudyPlannerApp
2. cd StudyPlannerAppUI
3. dotnet run

You can also use -dotnet clean- then -dotnet build- commands to make sure all the code is complied and ready to be executed!
